- move offset into Redux
  - create actions
    - increaseOffset (to be used when fetchMoreRecipes is called)
    - resetOffset (to be used by search bar submit)
    - setOffset (to be used when recipes are not re-rendered)

- logic to stop calls to db

- move offset into search object in state (just to clean things up)

- fix problem where state is not cleared when searching for new recipes, either by resetting the recipe state when a new term is searched, or by syncing recipe array length with offset after the search has completed in order to sync up the offset with what is displayed

- create Header component that is sticky and holds logo, nav and search bar

- add Footer with small amount of information

- style the app

- write documentation for both python and node.js parts of the app
